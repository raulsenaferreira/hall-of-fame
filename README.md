Assessment System of Studentes and Researchers

#### Who are the best students and Researchers of computer science ?
This system aim to show, in a funny way, who are the best student and reseracher curriculum based on their academic records found in Curriculum Lattes and other important platforms (e.g. performance in contests systems and others).

#### How this works?
This system makes use of [ScriptLattes](https://bitbucket.org/scriptlattes/scriptlattes) to get rich information from [Lattes Platform](http://lattes.cnpq.br/). Unfortunatelly, brazilian government restricted the data access to this platform by the use of captcha in their search functionality. An online petition against this restriction can be seen [here](https://www.change.org/p/peti%C3%A7%C3%A3o-para-a-retirada-dos-captchas-dos-curr%C3%ADculos-da-plataforma-lattes).

A website and a webservice is under construction to build calculations and aggregate collected info from researchers aiming to buld a rank of studentes and researchers production in a modern interface using gamification and others features.

The first implementations will be here soon. You are welcome to participate of this iniative, to do this, just fork this project, create a branch and make a pull request.
